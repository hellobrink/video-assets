00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.000


00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.760


00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.160


00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.240


00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.920
These oversimplified
labels get us nowhere.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.360
And we are tired of them.
Aren't you?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.200
As the world's storms swoosh around us.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.840
We aim to be more like mountains.
Touched by the winds,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.760
but not swept along with them.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.360
Staying solid in what we know to be true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
In a world of false hero
and villain narratives.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.840
We know nuance is our rebellious, radical act.
We know the best way to hold each

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.880
other to account is by building trust.
Not fear.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.160
We know the more diverse a team is,
the better their work will be.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.640
We know that hope is most powerful
when galvanised with action and a plan.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.880
And while working with nuance,
trust, and respect

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.480
might sound really 'nice'.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080
It's also a proven way to better results.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
We also know that when it comes
to preventable crises in health,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.960
education, and climate,
progress isn't fast enough.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.760
At Brink

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.400
it's this crisis that will keep
holding our care and attention.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.880
Not the storms.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.800
Issues that need clear-headed,
courageous people to stand

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.520
together through the headwinds.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.960
Like the mountains.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.320
If that sounds like you, let's partner up.
